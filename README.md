# pbo.js
Pbo.js is a JavaScript library for packing and unpacking Arma's .pbo files in memory.

The library supports packing and unpacking of PBO files. Currently does not support compressed files.


The example.html contains a basic example and documentation of each function for unpacking.
The arma.zone folder contains a copy of the https://arma.zone/ PBO unpacking implementation. Not the prettiest.
